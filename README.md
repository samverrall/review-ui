## Motivation 

Like a lot of other develoeprs in 2026, I use coding agents directly in my terminal to generate code. However, reviewing and supplying feedback to these agents is cumbersome. I wanted a simple TUI tool that can help me review uncommited git changes and export my comments to clipboard or a file to supply back to my coding agent.

## Features

- TUI interface to review uncommited git changes
- Navigate through changed files
- Add comments to specific lines of code or a selection of lines
- Export comments to clipboard or a file
- Intuitive keyboard only control
